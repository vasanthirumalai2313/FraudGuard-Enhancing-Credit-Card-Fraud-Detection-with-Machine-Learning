**FraudGuard: Enhancing Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning**

Welcome to FraudGuard! This project focuses on enhancing credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions and minimize financial risks.

**Project Overview**
FraudGuard aims to leverage various machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy. This repository includes code for data exploration, dataset balancing, model building, performance evaluation, and visualization.

**Key Components**

**1. Data Exploration**

Objective: Analyze the credit card transactions dataset to understand class distributions and feature correlations.
Details: Examination of transaction data, class imbalances, and feature relationships.

**2. Balancing the Dataset**

Objective: Address the class imbalance issue by sampling legitimate transactions.
Details: Creation of a balanced dataset containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

**3. Model Building**

**Algorithms Implemented:**

**Logistic Regression 🚀:** A fundamental algorithm for binary classification.

**Random Forest Classifier 🌳:** An ensemble method for improved classification accuracy.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM) 🌐:** A powerful algorithm for classification tasks.

**Details:** Training and evaluation of models on accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

**4. Performance Evaluation**

**Metrics Used:**
Confusion Matrices
Classification Reports
ROC Curves
AUC Scores

**Details:** Comparison of model performance to identify the most effective algorithm.

**5. Visualization**
**Visualizations Created:**
**Correlation Heatmaps 🔍:** To understand feature correlations.
**Distribution of Transaction Amounts 💵:** To analyze the spread of transaction amounts.
**Time Series Analysis of Transactions 📅:** To observe transaction patterns over time.
**Model Performance Comparison 📊:** To visualize and compare the performance of different models.
